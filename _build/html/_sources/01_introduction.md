## Abstract

Mining operations generate large amounts of wastes which are usually stored into waste rock piles (WRP) and tailing storage facilities (TSF) on the surface. These large-scale storage facilities pose major environmental concerns and must be properly monitored to manage the risk of failures with disastrous consequences and also to control the generation of contaminated mine drainage. In this context, non-invasive monitoring techniques such as time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography (TL-ERT) are promising since they provide large-scale internal information of the subsurface that complement surface observations (walkover, aerial photogrammetry or remote sensing) and traditional monitoring tools (moisture, suction or temperature probes or piezometers), which often sample a tiny proportion of the mining waste storage facilities. This review describes the theoretical basis of geoelectrical monitoring and provides an overview of TL-ERT applications and developments over the last 30 years. A database of over 650 case studies is used to highlight the development of this monitoring technique to various fields of applications in recent years, not limited to mining operations (e.g. landslide, permafrost or $CO_2$ storage monitoring for instance). In addition, this review focuses on the applications of ERT for mining waste characterization and monitoring and a database of 150 case studies is used to identify promising applications for long-term autonomous geoelectrical monitoring of the geotechnical and geochemical stability of WRPs and TSFs. Moreover, the potential challenges that could emerge from a broader adoption of TL-ERT monitoring for mining wastes are discussed. Finally, the review of recent advances in instrumentation, data acquisition, processing and interpretation for long-term monitoring helps to draw future research perspectives, which could help improve the design and accuracy of future geoelectric monitoring programs in mining wastes. In particular, several promising avenues are proposed to improve data quality, increase spatio-temporal resolution and upscale future TL-ERT surveys on mining wastes while reducing the uncertainty associated with geoelectrical monitoring of key physical parameters in WRPs and TSFs.
