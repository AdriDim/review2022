<h1>Mining ERT database<a class="headerlink" href="#mining-ert-database" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This webpage presents the database of studies applying <strong>Electrical Resistivity Tomography</strong> (ERT) in the context of <strong>mining wastes</strong>. <strong>Over 100 studies</strong> using ERT, published from 1990 to 2020, have been identified for the review. Each study has been classified according to the type of application.</p>
<p>This database may be of help to describe the <strong>developments of ERT</strong> for mining waste <strong>valorization</strong>, mining waste <strong>characterization</strong> and mining waste <strong>stability monitoring</strong>. You may also use it to <strong>find relevant references</strong> for your field of expertise !</p>
<p>Moreover, this review helps identifying <strong>future promising applications of TL-ERT for long-term mining waste monitoring</strong>.</p>

<h2>Quick look at the database<a class="headerlink" href="#quick-look-at-the-database" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>mining waste ERT database</strong> references published studies from 1990 to 2020 using ERT for mining waste imaging and monitoring. Each study is identified by an unique <strong>ID</strong> (the name of the main author and the year of publication). Other characteristics have also been recorded in the database such as the <strong>title</strong> of the study, the <strong>journal</strong> where it has been published, the <strong>type of application</strong>, the <strong>country</strong> where the study has been carried out and others.</p>
<p>As described in the review, the types of applications have been classified into three broader categories :</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Mining waste valorization</strong> <em>(Tool for heap leaching, revalorization of mineralized wastes)</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mining waste characterization</strong> <em>(Waste characterization, acid mine drainage detection)</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mining waste monitoring</strong> <em>(Geochemical and geotechnical mining waste stability monitoring)</em></p></li>
</ul>
